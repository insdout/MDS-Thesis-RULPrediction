abstract = {Through-life Engineering Services (TES) are essential in the manufacture and servicing of complex engineering products. TES improves support services by providing prognosis of run-to-failure and time-to-failure on-demand data for better decision making. The concept of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is utilised to predict life-span of components (of a service system) with the purpose of minimising catastrophic failure events in both manufacturing and service sectors. The purpose of this paper is to identify failure mechanisms and emphasise the failure events prediction approaches that can effectively reduce uncertainties. It will demonstrate the classification of techniques used in RUL prediction for optimisation of products’ future use based on current products in-service with regards to predictability, availability and reliability. It presents a mapping of degradation mechanisms against techniques for knowledge acquisition with the objective of presenting to designers and manufacturers ways to improve the life-span of components.}

abstract = {Data-driven techniques, especially on artificial intelligence (AI) such as deep learning (DL) techniques, have attracted more and more attention in the manufacturing sector because of the growth of industrial Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data. Tremendous researches of DL techniques have been applied in machine health monitoring, but still very limited works focus on the application of DL on the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction. Precise RUL prediction can significantly improve the reliability and operational safety of the industrial components or systems, avoid fatal breakdown and reduce the maintenance costs. This paper gives a brief introduction of RUL prediction and reviews the start-of-the-art DL approaches in terms of four main representative deep architectures, including Auto-encoder, Deep Belief Network (DBN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). It has been observed that DL techniques attract growing interests on RUL prediction that suggests a promising future of their applications in manufacturing.}

abstract = {Accurately predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of a lithium-ion battery is essential for health management of both the battery and its host device. We propose a physics-based prognostics approach for prediction of the capacity and RUL of an implantable-grade lithium-ion battery by simultaneously considering multiple degradation mechanisms, including the losses of active materials of the positive and negative electrodes and the loss of lithium inventory. Unlike traditional capacity-based prognostics that exclusively relies on the empirical capacity fade trend, the proposed approach leverages a half-cell model to 1) estimate degradation parameters from voltage and capacity measurements to quantify the degradation mechanisms and 2) predict the capacity fade trend based on the estimated parameters. We compare the performance of the proposed physics-based approach with that of the traditional capacity-based approach on eight implantable-grade lithium-ion cells that have been subjected to continuous charge–discharge cycling over 1.5 years at high temperature. The proposed approach achieves a more accurate RUL prediction than the traditional capacity-based approach. The results show that the proposed physics-based approach, which extrapolates the degradation parameters, can provide a more accurate and conservative RUL prediction when compared to extrapolating just the capacity.}

abstract = {In the present study, the application of a diagnostic method using a physics-based model is proposed during engine verification testing. A physics-based engine model is constructed, based on a 0-dimensional system analysis method, and then revised through performance adaptation with a basic engine model. Adaptation factors are used for the compressor, secondary air system, nozzle, exhaust gas temperature, and engine thrust. Gas path analysis is conducted using the physics-based engine model and the performance test data in real time. A health parameter that can quantitatively evaluate the performance difference of components was defined. Health parameters for the compressor capacity and efficiency, secondary air system, and nozzle are calculated from the gas path analysis. The multi-variable Newton–Raphson method is employed for the performance adaptation and gas path analysis in real time. A single-shaft gas turbine engine, which is constructed based on the core part of a turbofan engine currently under development, is utilized to test and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Three tests are performed for engine verification. The proposed diagnostic method is applied to the aero gas turbine engine verification test. In 33 test cases, the fault detection rates for the compressor's variable guide vane, secondary air system, and variable area nozzle are 100%, 91%, and 79%, respectively. As a result, it is confirmed that the proposed method can simultaneously detect abnormalities in the compressor's variable guide vane, secondary air system, and variable area nozzle. In addition, this study indicates that applying the physics-based engine model to the diagnostics logic can effectively detect failures with a small amount of data.}

abstract = "{Rolling element bearings are very important and highly utilized in many industries. Their catastrophic failure due to fluctuating working conditions leads to unscheduled breakdown and increases accidental economical losses. Thus these issues have triggered a need for reliable and automatic prognostics methodology which will prevent a potentially expensive maintenance program. Accordingly, Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction based on artificial intelligence is an attractive methodology for several researchers. In this study, data-driven condition monitoring approach is implemented for predicting RUL of bearing under a certain load and speed. The approach demonstrates the use of ensemble regression techniques like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for prediction of RUL with time-domain features which are extracted from given vibration signals. The extracted features are ranked using Decision Tree (DT) based ranking technique and training and testing feature vectors are produced and fed as an input to ensemble technique. Hyper-parameters are tuned for these models by using exhaustive parameter search and performance of these models is further verified by plotting respective learning curves. For the present work FEMTO bearing data-set provided by IEEE PHM Data Challenge 2012 is used. Weibull Hazard Rate Function for each bearing from learning data set is used to find target values i.e. projected RUL of the bearings. Results of proposed models are compared with well-established data-driven approaches from literature and are found to be better than all the models applied on this data-set, thereby demonstrating the reliability of the proposed model.}",

abstract="Prognostics technique aims to accurately estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a subsystem or a component using sensor data, which has many real world applications. However, many of the existing algorithms are based on linear models, which cannot capture the complex relationship between the sensor data and RUL. Although Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) has been applied to predict RUL, it cannot learn salient features automatically, because of its network structure. A novel deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based regression approach for estimating the RUL is proposed in this paper. Although CNN has been applied on tasks such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition etc., this is the first attempt to adopt CNN for RUL estimation in prognostics. Different from the existing CNN structure for computer vision, the convolution and pooling filters in our approach are applied along the temporal dimension over the multi-channel sensor data to incorporate automated feature learning from raw sensor signals in a systematic way. Through the deep architecture, the learned features are the higher-level abstract representation of low-level raw sensor signals. Furthermore, feature learning and RUL estimation are mutually enhanced by the supervised feedback. We compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms on two publicly available data sets to evaluate the effectiveness of this proposed approach. The encouraging results demonstrate that our proposed deep convolutional neural network based regression approach for RUL estimation is not only more efficient but also more accurate.",

However, the accurate physical or expert models are not available in most cases. This paper proposes a new data-driven approach for prognostics using deep convolution neural networks (DCNN). Time window approach is employed for sample preparation in order for better feature extraction by DCNN. Raw collected data with normalization are directly used as inputs to the proposed network, and no prior expertise on prognostics and signal processing is required, that facilitates the application of the proposed method. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, experiments on the popular C-MAPSS dataset for aero-engine unit prognostics are carried out. High prognostic accuracy on the RUL estimation is achieved. The superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparisons with other popular approaches and the state-of-the-art results on the same dataset. The results of this study suggest that the proposed data-driven prognostic method offers a new and promising approach.}

abstract = {Unpredictable failures and unscheduled maintenance of physical systems increases production resources, produces more harmful waste for the environment, and increases system life cycle costs. Efficient remaining useful life (RUL) estimation can alleviate such an issue. The RUL is predicted by making use of the data collected from several types of sensors that continuously record different indicators about a working asset, such as vibration intensity or exerted pressure. This type of continuous monitoring data is sequential in time, as it is collected at a certain rate from the sensors during the asset's work. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network models have been demonstrated to be efficient throughout the literature when dealing with sequential data because of their ability to retain a lot of information over time about previous states of the system. This paper proposes using a new LSTM architecture for predicting the RUL when given short sequences of monitored observations with random initial wear. By using LSTM, this paper proposes a new objective function that is suitable for the RUL estimation problem, as well as a new target generation approach for training LSTM networks, which requires making lesser assumptions about the actual degradation of the system.}

As an important role in PHM, remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is essential to maintain the reliability and safety of industrial manufacture. However, recent data-driven approaches for bearing RUL prediction do not weight the contributions of data from different sensors and time steps, which decreases the efficiency in the big data era. In this context, we present a deep learning-based RUL prediction method with an attention mechanism to weight sequence data representations. Specifically, the proposed method weights different industrial sensors and time steps, respectively, based on the distributed attention mechanism. Then, temporal convolution modules with the shared weights are used for feature extraction of time series. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is verified using a popular data set C-MAPSS. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method has high accuracy and is efficient in practical applications.},

abstract = {A new method for evaluating aircraft engine monitoring data is proposed. Commonly, prognostics and health management systems use knowledge of the degradation processes of certain engine components together with professional expert opinion to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL). New data-driven approaches have emerged to provide accurate diagnostics without relying on such costly processes. However, most of them lack an explanatory component to understand model learning and/or the nature of the data. To overcome this gap we propose a novel approach based on variational encoding. The model consists of a recurrent encoder and a regression model: the encoder learns to compress the input data to a latent space that serves as a basis to build a self-explanatory map that can visually evaluate the rate of deterioration of aircraft engines. Obtaining such a latent space is regularized by a new cost function guided by variational inference and a term that penalizes prediction errors. Consequently, not only an interpretable assessment is achieved but also a remarkable prognostic accuracy, outperforming most of the state-of-the-art approaches on the popular simulation dataset C-MAPSS from NASA. In addition, we demonstrate the application of our method in a real-world scenario with data from actual Turbofan engines.}
